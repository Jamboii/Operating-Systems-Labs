# Lab 01 - Objective Disassembly

A simple C program coupled with an objective disassembly line-by-line analysis. 

#### Task

• Write a C program that:

..– Has at least one loop (for / while / do-while)
..– Has at least one functions  you defined excluding main()
..– Calls the defined function from main()
..– Functions should declare at least one local variable
..– Calls any standard C library function

• Create assembly code using gcc/gas(-S switch)
• Create objective disassembly using objdump(-d switch)
• Explain the generated assembly code line by line
..- The standard C library portion can be skipped by just mentioning “This part is from the library function name XXX”
