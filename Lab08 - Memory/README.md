# Lab 08 - Memory

A program that passes a decimal virtual address and outputs its page number and offset.

### Task

**Part 1**

• Assume that a system has a 32-bit virtual address with a 4-KB page size. Write a program that is passed a virtual address (in decimal) on the command line and have it output the page number and offset for the given address. As an example, your program would run as follows:

./lab08_ex1 19986

Your program would output:

The address 19986 contains:
page number = 4
offset = 3602

• Writing this program will require using the appropriate data type to store 32 bits.
